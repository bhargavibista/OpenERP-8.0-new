Following are the changes which are done::::
1) Commmented default_get function in the product_configurator file (in wizard folder)
2) In the class named as "product.item.set.line" in the sale_bundle_product.py file, added one new field (product_name)
as related field because it was not containing name field and because of that when we select product it was showing product id instead
of product name
3) Added one xpath to show button in the tree view.
